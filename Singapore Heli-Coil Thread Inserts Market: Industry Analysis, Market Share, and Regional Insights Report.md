# Singapore Heli-Coil Thread Inserts Market: Industry Analysis, Market Share, and Regional Insights Report

<strong>Heli-Coil Thread Inserts Market Snapshot 2025-2033:</strong>

Heli-coil thread inserts are helical-shaped cold rolled wires with high strength, high wear resistance, corrosion resistance and heat resistant threads. Heli-coil thread inserts are mainly used in fastening systems. Different types of heli-coil thread inserts such as free running thread inserts, self-locking or screw locking thread inserts, tangless heli-coil thread inserts, etc. are used in fastening systems of automobiles and electronics appliances. Heli-coil thread inserts provide resilient locking systems that grips the bolt and prevents it from loosening under vibration or impact. Hence, these thread inserts were very useful in repeated assembly and disassembly without appreciable loss of self-locking torque. Heli-coil thread inserts save space and weight through elimination of lock nuts, lock wiring, lock washers, chemicals for locking systems, plastic pellets and other locking mechanisms, which in turn, reduce the cost of locking system or fastening system.
